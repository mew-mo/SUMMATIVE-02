-- PSEUDOCODE !!

What i am doing right now: PEOPLE SELECTION

1. Pull round buttons from DOM
2. Assign appropriate values from 1-4 to each button
3. Apply functionality that assigns appropriate value to userobject value -- log to ensure it's working
4. celebrate successful code <3


ToDo (probably at home):
* hero Logo

// no pseudocode needed for this step > non js step!


-- CURRENT PROBLEMS !!

1. figuring out how to minify my custom js with gulp.


-- EXTRAS !!

1. animated transitions, make it more exciting
2. loading prior to the actual page load-in
3. extra fun animations on the next/back buttons and other buttons :)
4. background image adjusting cleanly based on user interaction


-- COMPLETED PSEUDOCODE SECTIONS !!

// TRANSITIONS
//
// 1. Pull back and next buttons from DOM
// 2. Add event listeners- create functions to move slide forward on click of next arrow, back on click of back arrow
// 3. celebrate successful implementation

// i am also trying to set up my slick to have more function based code rather than slamming everything in the init function

// finishing getting DOM resources for my html document
//   * calendars
//   * mapbox stuff
